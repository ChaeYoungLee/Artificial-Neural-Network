# Artificial-Neural-Network

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an algorithm that applies data-processing structure of neurons of the brain to logic circuit. Early ANN focused on the implementation of biological neural network theory to a logic gate. However, ANN has progressed while proposing the solution of XOR problem. Today it became a representative algorithm of subsymbolic-learning which can be applied universally to classification problem. The most important feature of ANN is that it can be trained through backpropagation. We conducted the study by training XOR gate in ANN.

This project contains ANN code written in Python 2. Two types of xor are used to test the code. Remember that the input includes a bias "1" in its rightmost column.
