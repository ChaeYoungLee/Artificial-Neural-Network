# Artificial-Neural-Network

Artificial neural network (ANN) is an algorithm inspired by the human brain. It is composed of three sections: input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. Input nodes match to specific hidden nodes where they are multiplied by a changeable floating number. The hidden nodes undergo the identical process and generate the output nodes. These outputs are compared with the aim value, and adjustments of weight values are made to achieve the ideal output. Hence, this process of back propagation is repeated to train the algorithm and find the optimal value.

This repository contains ANN code written in Python 2. Two types of xor are used to test the code. Remember that the input includes a bias "1" in its rightmost column.
